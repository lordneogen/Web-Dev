<h1>Make All the Headers</h1>
<h4>Websites have different ways to show you, the user, what is important. Take for example...</h4>
<h3>Big Important Words!</h3>
<h2>This style of text Big Important Words! is called a header. This should look familiar because almost every website uses headers.

  The New York Times mobile site uses them. Check out all of the images below. The heading has a red square around each heading.</h2>
<p>Add your headers below this paragraph element! Add an h1, h2, h3, and h4. You should see your new headers displayed in the preview pane.
</p>
<p>Don't forget to add some text to your headers. They won't display anything otherwise.
